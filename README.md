# COVID 19-Analysis-Data-Engineering-project

I am going to execute the entire data engineering project step by step using COVID 19 data available on AWS Open Dataset. I have explained everything from building data architecture, preparing data, analysis of data, and many more...
In this project, we analyze the data provided by the COVID-19 project and use data mining to find patterns, trends, and risk factors for COVID-19 infection.
